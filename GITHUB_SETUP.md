# GitHub Setup Instructions for VendorSync

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com
2. Click "New repository" (green button)
3. Repository name: `vendorsync`
4. Description: `Complete vendor management system with Firebase integration`
5. Keep it Public (or Private if you prefer)
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect Local Repository
After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vendorsync.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.
